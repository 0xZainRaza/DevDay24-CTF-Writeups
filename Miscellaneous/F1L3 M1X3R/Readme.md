find password of encrypted zip file via images, then find hidden flag in word file.
the passsword is encoded, add fake passwords in other 2 images and 1 image has nothing important.

1.

So after that, enter this password to zip files.
and you will see two files in each zip, word file or song file.
each word has encrypted hidden flag.
