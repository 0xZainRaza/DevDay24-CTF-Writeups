# Can You Crack This
## Description
One of the famous personalities recently visited Pakistan, and my friend welcomed him warmly. He treated him to a delicious meal at a fantastic restaurant, but unfortunately, I forgot the name of the restaurant. Can you help me?

- HINT: If you're hungry, in a hurry, and have only five dollar in your pocket, you might stop at a fast food restaurant for a burger and a soda.
