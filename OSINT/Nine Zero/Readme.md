The latest picture on the account indicates that the user visited a BMW auto showroom and we can confirm that because in the second picture we can see that the user is driving a BMW. When you zoom in the last picture you can see these words "BMW Niederlassung Saarbrücken". They transalet to BMW branch Saarbrücken.

So now let search for a BMW showroom in Saarbrücken on google maps and we can find it easily on the maps. The user had an issue fixed regarding his car so maybe he left a review of the place that can give us a hint. When we go through the reviews we can indeed find the flag poasted by a user Work Aura
